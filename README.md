# Python-Server
## Bash Script
A better and faster way to execute:

- Start a Python HTTP server
- Simply type 'eh' and hit the tab key
- It grabs the tun0 IP address and displays it in the terminal
- Automatically saves the URL to the clipboard
- No need for manual IP checking (ifconfig)
- Displays an error message if tun0 does not exist

However, when using 'python3 -m http.server,' you won't receive a message indicating that 'tun0' does not exist. 
It continues to run as usual until you realize that 'tun0' is not available.
